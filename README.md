# Home Assistant Add-on: BoringProxy-client

[aarch64-shield]: https://img.shields.io/badge/aarch64-yes-green.svg

A simple client that connects to a BoringProxy-server.
This is a solution to give a selfhosted HomeAssistant a public IP (provided you have a free/cheap VPS or AWS somewhere).
Much respect goes to @anderspitman, he is the creator of BoringProxy. Awesome work!
